# Furniture-Swapping-App

## Plan

1. Create database of users and furniture items
   Furniture table: 
        a) type
        b) description
        c) price range value
        - Users have many furtniture items
        - Furniture items only have one user 
2. Connect database with Sinatra
3. Work on front-end
        - User can post their own piece of furniture on the site
        - User can request a trade if they like a piece of furniture
            a) when request is made, user will be asked which one of their furniture items they want to trade. They will also be prompted to send a message along with the request.
        - Users can search for furniture (onclick will connect to description)

### Stretch Deliverables

1. Add more items (clothing, household appliances, cards, etc)
2. Expand our database so that we can keep track of transactions
